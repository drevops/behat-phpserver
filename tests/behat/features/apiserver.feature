Feature: API Server
  In order to test API responses
  As a developer
  I want to be able to configure the API server in various ways

  # No common background because we need to restart the server for each scenario

  #
  # Basic functionality
  #
  Scenario: Check the API server is running
    Given API server is running
    And API server is reset
    When I send a GET request to "/admin/status" in the API server
    Then the response status code should be 200
    And the response header should contain "X-Received-Requests" with value "0"
    And the response header should contain "X-Queued-Responses" with value "0"

  Scenario: API server reset functionality clears responses and requests
    Given API server is running
    And the API will respond with:
      """
      {
        "code": 200,
        "reason": "OK",
        "headers": {
          "Content-Type": "application/json"
        },
        "body": {
          "test": "data"
        }
      }
      """
    When I send a GET request to "/admin/status" in the API server
    Then the response header should contain "X-Queued-Responses" with value "1"
    When API server is reset
    And I send a GET request to "/admin/status" in the API server
    Then the response header should contain "X-Received-Requests" with value "0"
    And the response header should contain "X-Queued-Responses" with value "0"

  Scenario: Assert that incorrectly formatted API responses trigger an error
    Given API server is running
    And API server is reset
    When I send a GET request to "/someurl1" in the API server
    Then the response status code should be 500
    And the response should not contain header "X-Received-Requests"
    And the response should not contain header "X-Queued-Responses"
    And the response header should contain "Content-Length" with value "33"
    And the response should contain "No responses in queue"

  #
  # JSON responses
  #
  Scenario: Assert that a single API response is returned correctly
    Given API server is running
    And API server is reset
    Given the API will respond with:
